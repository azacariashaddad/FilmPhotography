# Italy

Trip: 2025-04-15

Welcome to my new blog about Italy! In this post, I’ll be sharing my journey through Naples, the Amalfi Coast, and Palermo in Sicily — all captured on 35mm film. From the bustling streets of Naples to the stunning coastal views of the Amalfi Coast and the vibrant history of Palermo, every stop offered something unique. I’ll take you through the highlights of each location, and of course, share some of my favorite photos from the trip.
